[*] add colors from the grasshopper
    [*] export colors
    [*] attach colors to the points
    // colors are hard to get from Grasshoper. data is not good. use distances in index.js to generate colors instead
[*] generate the colors from distances
    // confusing function using hue, but works.
[*] reverse the animation - the scenario is as follows:
    [*] point animation reversed
    [*] animation in chunks
    [*] lines repair
    [*] synchronize lines
    - container shows up
    - dirty grid
    - perhaps animate color in
    - lines get towards root cause
    - root cause arises
    - root cause gets taken out
    - lines fade out
    - grid flows back to normal
    - continue scroll
[*] add base plane from the grasshopper
[ ] lines need fixing
[ ] add lines from other sides
    * start from further sides
    * once the dista is the same from both sides, start the animation from closer sides
    * the end should be when row and column lines get to root cause



[ ] change background color
[*] perhaps import 3d directly from grasshopper - possibly slow
    // absolutely slow
[ ] perhaps generate spheres in place of points
[ ] spheres change size by the vicinity of the root cause
[ ] once the root cause is found, animate removal and animate back to smooth grid
